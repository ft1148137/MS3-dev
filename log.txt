I have install the H4R_EV3 on my ev3. But there is no battery display by this system.....

I am thinking about to buy a chargeable battery. The battery by Lego cost 100 euro, emmmmm.
I mount the Roboter and make some photo. I will upload them.

I decide to use Rasberry with lego brick. That is enough for now. But later i want to use a camera to do localization.
I guess Pi it not enough. Perhaps Jeston nano is a good choice. But Jeston nano does not support ros kinetic.So i should
use melodic or make a serial synchro communication between pi and Jeston. But how? use boost::asio? or socket? I am not
sure.

I have install ros-melodic on Pi4(kinetic is not possible). following this Tutorial https://www.zouinstructables.com/id/ROS-Melodic-on-Raspberry-Pi-4-RPLIDAR/.
But during installation i have got some broken pkg. download them manual and use dpkg force overwrite to fix this.
after 1 hour complie i have install the ros on Raspbian in p4. But the apt can not get ros source tree in Raspbian(i guesse).
So when i want install some dependence, i have to download them and complie them. I just put them in my workspace.
Perhaps there are other way to install them in ros lib.

The H4R_EV3Â´s sourece code have some problems by complie. It is possible, that the dependence in melodic have changed.
I have changed source code and now it running. I am thinking about using ev3dev wiht dokcer to use cross-complie in Rasberry,
because the resource in pi4 is not enough for complie. But now my Laptop (in company) is limtited. I will try it later in 
my private computer.

I finsih the line follower and upload the programm and the path.now i am writing the datafusion with Kalmanfilter.
I need to use ROS message_filter and ntp to synchro the message from pi and lego brick.i make 7 dimension kalmanfiler.torrow
i will test it with line follower.

I have made the tf tree and EKF for LEGO. Now i can see the all data in rviz. The problem now is how can i calibrate the bno55 and set the parameter for ekf.
I am not sure how to set the cov-matrics. After calibration i will test the EKF with line follower and try to find the right parameter for ekf
